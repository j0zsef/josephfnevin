# Personal Site React
I decided to rebuild my personal site using React. The site you are currently navigating is the finished product.
React has become my main focus for web development and thought my personal site should reflect that. I have been using React
professionally for the past year and wanted to showcase my (basic/moderate) skills.

Another reason for this rebuild was to display some of my projects. I felt that Next would be a good choice for this because of the dynamic routing.
Also, I am a fan of the opinionated structure of Next. It makes development easier and faster.

Finally, I wanted to learn how to deploy a React site using AWS. I have deployed websites professionally using Terraform and Cloudfront. 
In addition, I deployed my previous personal site using Netlify. It was time for a new challenge.


## Frontend Technologies
- React
- Next
- React-Bootstrap
- AWS

## UI
Write about theming with React-Bootstrap.

## Deployment
I deployed the site using AWS. I used S3 to host the site and Cloudfront to serve the site. I also used Route 53 to manage the domain.
TBD - I will write a blog post on how I deployed the site.
