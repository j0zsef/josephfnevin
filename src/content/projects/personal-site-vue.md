# Personal Site Vue
This was my first attempt at building a personal site. I was heavily using Vue at the time and wanted to test my skills.
An extremely primitive attempt but at least I got something out into the ether.

## Technologies
- Vue
- Nuxt
- TailwindCSS
- Netlify

## UI

Very plain and basic:

## Deployment
I deployed the site using Netlify. I used Netlify to host the site and manage the domain.
